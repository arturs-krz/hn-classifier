fitness function normally measuresprogress towards objective the search space, effectively acting an objectivefunction. through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent objective being reached. while methods exist mitigate deception, leave underlying pathology untreated: objective functions themselvesmay actively misdirect search towards dead ends. paper proposes approach circumventing deception also yields new perspective open-ended evolution: instead either explicitly seeking objective modeling natural evolution capture open-endedness, idea is simplysearch behavioral novelty. in objective-based problem, such noveltysearch ignores objective. many points the search space collapse a single behavior, search novelty is often feasible. furthermore, there are so many simple behaviors, search novelty leads increasing complexity. decoupling open-ended search artificial lifeworlds, search novelty is applicable real world problems. counterintuitively, the maze navigation biped walking tasks this paper,novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting strange conclusion some problems are best solved methods ignore objective. main

multiobjectivationabstract: novelty search is recent promising approach evolve neurocontrollers, especially drive robots. main idea is maximize novelty behaviors instead the efficiency. however, abandoning efficiency objective(s) may too radical many contexts. this paper, pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithmis employed reconcile novelty search objective-based optimization following multiobjectivization process. several multiobjectivizations based behavioral novelty on behavioral diversity are compared a maze navigation task. results show the bi-objective variant novelty + fitness is better fine-tuning behaviors basic novelty search, while keeping comparable number iterations converge.

discovers wide diversity welladaptedvirtual creatures within single run. unlike nature,evolving creatures virtual worlds tend converge a single morphology selection therein greedily rewards morphology is easiest exploit. however,novelty search, technique explicitly rewards diverging, potentially mitigate such convergence. thus thispaper existing creature evolution platform is extended multi-objective search balances drives bothnovelty performance. however, are different ways combine performance-driven search novelty search. suggested approach is provide evolution both novelty
