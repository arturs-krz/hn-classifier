(mandatory)parameter: swift testcase folder. given, files the destination folder are compared the files thisfolder. (optional)kotlift uses various regular expressions a simple structure tree. advanced kotlift usage your project, modify replacementfile.json customizereplacements (such .tostring() .myswiftytostringfunction()). include kotlift.swift file your project a basic mapping the important kotlin std-lib functions are different swift.dependencieskotlin 1.0.1contribution guidelines every transpiled language feature is kotlin test file test-src a swift file test-dest.executing kotlift a fourth argument only transpiles test files, also checks for differences.pull requests are welcome. you add features, please add kotlin swift test files.please contact valentin.slawicek@moshbit.com any inquiries."
