multi-tenant website written ruby.trigger-happy - similar solution, written a reusable django application. with much fewer recipes. services implemented web automation a service different targeting: this that - targeted iot mobile devices.bip.io - both open source paid hosted solutions.projects don't follow saas :home assistant - home automation platform web automation capabilities.kibitzr - command-line utility extendable python bash scripts.projects attempting automate browser automation:import.io turns websites structured apis.portia scrapes web sites without programming knowledge required.kimono - tool manual web page data extraction.open source libraries parsing scraping web sites:selenium - state the art library browser automation. supports popular platforms browsers.'s primary case is web applications testing.'s tedious configuration has high entry barrier.beautifulsoup parses malformed html.scrapy - fast powerful scraping web crawling framework.zapierzapier is most popular web automation app.zapier runs zaps. zap is blueprint a task want do and .in words, zap looks this: \" i a thing a, this thing b.\" first part is trigger the second part is action.zapier supports hundreds apps. can mix match triggers actions automate about anything. example might \"when get new entry a wufoo form, create new lead salesforce.\"zapier thrives granularity. user pick fields the trigger service should to action service. instance, phone number wufoo form should the phone the salesforce lead.huginnhuginn is closest free alternative zapier.'s multi-tenant system building agents perform automated online tasks.huginn started 2013. has built broad community hundreds contributors.huginn organizes directed graphs events passing between different types agents. are more 50 types agents. user builds pipelines predefined agent types inside browser.huginn stores ruby agents inside subdirectory. operating huginn requires mysql postgresql database nginx server.installation is pretty involved, well documented., the project maintains docker image, simplifies installation lot.trigger happytrigger-happy is huginn design. is reusable django application. community is smaller, the project doesn't much attention days.project lives life slow sure. has 900 stars github 1000 triggers configured 200 users the website.bipiobipio approaches web automation a slightly different angle.instead providing api wrappers popular online services, zapier, bases web hooks organized graph pipelines.bipio is graph pipelining api talking restful json, where each node your graph handles discrete unit work.such transforming messages, integrating \"cloud\" api many types web-based rpc's.user configures bips defining graph (hub) across nodes (channels).channels perform discrete unit work emit predictable result.collections similar channels live shared resource containers called pods.iftttifttt pushes idea web automation wearables smart home appliances.ifttt provides applets mobile devices hook the platform.home assistanthome assistant is open source home automation platform. is capable tracking, controlling automating lights, media players other \"smart\" devices home.home assistant deployed any machine runs python 3 - a raspberry pi a nas device. integrates many open-source commercial offerings ifttt amazon echo.sensors restful services advanced http handlers fit web automation needs.kibitzrkibitzr serves list checks defined a single yaml file.each check is pipeline following steps:fetch content;pass through sequence transforms;run set notifiers.each step contain arbitrary bash python code snippets.kibitzr runs wherever python is available (version 2 well 3). has user interface doesn't need database.being late the party, kibitzr doesn't try have possible integrations built-.instead, hooks other web automation providers missing parts. has -class support browser automation. to choose right solution? is silver bullet, each solution has pros cons.try diagram alsoawesome-selfhosted has section automation.node-red - programming tool wiring together hardware devices, apis online services new interesting ways.aws lambda - serverless compute platform suitable web automation tasks.kubernetes jobs - serverless platform google.openwhisk -
