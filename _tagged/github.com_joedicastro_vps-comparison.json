is copy/paste those tables that file this , and only key combinations table/graph job is almost done ( can move/add/delete columns very easily org-mode). is another python script (/ansible~/roles/common/files/clean_ips.py) automatically removes public ipv4/ipv6 the log files ( on those is needed).warningperformance tests be affected locations, data centers vps host neighbors. is inherent the same nature the vps service can vary very significantly between instances the same plan. example, the tests performed realize comparison had found in plan ( included here, becasuse is more $5/mo) new instance usually give unixbench index ~1700 achieved unixbench index 629,8. s considerable amount lost performance a vps server the same price! the performance vary time, due the vps host neighbors. of i discarded instance would report poor performance only show typical values a given plan.automation have chosen ansible automate tests recollect information the vps servers once the roles are write down s pretty easy anyone replicate and its own results a little effort. first thing you to is edit /ansible/hosts file use own servers. the template provided are real ips present, serves as guide how manage . for example this server:[digitalocean]-5bucks-ubuntu ansible_host=x.x.x.x ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 should to put own server ip. interpreter path is needed there is a python 2 interpreter available default ( in ubuntu). im using variables per group declare default user a server, im grouping servers provider. , a complete example a provider using new instance running ubuntu should like :[new_provider]new_provider-plan_name-ubuntu ansible_host=x.x.x.x ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3[new_provider:vars]ansible_user=root you add many servers/providers you . if are already familiar ansible, can suit inventory file (/ansible/hosts) you need., you start tests servers/providers using ansible running playbook, should a idea test access with ping ( the /ansible folder):$ ansible -m ping its first that are sshing a server, are probably going be asked add to ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. you easily execute the tasks a server :$ ansible-playbook site.yml -f 6 the -f 6 option can specify many forks want create execute tasks parallel, default is 5 as use here 6 vps plans use 6 forks. can run selected tasks/roles using tags. can list the available tasks:$ ansible-playbook site.yml --list-tasks run the tags you :$ ansible-playbook site.yml -t benchmark the roles are set store logs the tests the /logs/ folder using /logs/server_name folder structure.warning: the tests i include here are atomic possible, is in every of i try leave server a state close it was before perform , with exception i keep logs. the , the logs are stored the /tmp folder intentionally they disappear you reboot instance. are three main reasons why try make tests atomic possible do take advantage some common tasks perform only once: plans so little disk space available if do erase auxiliary files packages between tests, run of space soon, worse, of until point make unavailable ssh connections (e.g. ovh), making necessary manual intervention the control panel ruining advantage the automation ansible us. want little interference possible between tests, try perform always a state close the default of instance. of (e.g. lynis, ports) change results significantly they are performed some the package/configuration changes other tests . in way, with clever of ansible tags, can perform individual tests without need execute entire ansible playbook.perhaps only major drawback this approach is it consumes more globally you perform the tests together.location so the instances were allocated london (gb), except ovh vps ssd 1 gravelines (fr) scaleway vc1s paris (fr). the instances were running ubuntu 16.04 ltscurrently vultrs 20gb ssd plan is sold and is unavailable temporarily, thus only performed tests ( some a previous

is provide basic indicator the performance a unix- system; hence, multiple tests are used test various aspects the systems performance. test results are compared the scores a baseline system produce index value, is generally easier handle the raw scores. entire set index values is combined make overall index the system.keep mind, this index is very influenced the cpu raw power, does reflect very another aspects disk performance. this index, more is better. only execute test once it takes time - 30-45 minutes depending the server- the variations between several runs are almost never

speedtest.net service measure average download/upload network speed the vps server. do i the awesome speedtest-cli python script be able do from command line.keep mind this test is very reliable depends lot the network capabilities status the speedtests nodes ( try choose always fastest node each city). it gives an idea the network interconnections each provider. those tests more is

nginx, db, wich php, cache use, etc) also all process easier m going use bitnami stacks install both programs. when m specially fond bitnami stacks ( would other components), being self-contained helps lot make easier task atomic revert server the end the previous state. use real products, with dummy blog pages, makes great difference using a hello world! html page, specially wordpress also stresses heavily database. bitnamis wordpress stack uses apache 2.4, mysql 5.7, php 7, varnish 4.1, wordpress 4.7 ghost stack uses apache 2.4, node.js 6.10, sqlite 3.7, python 2.7 y ghost 0.11 perform tests m going use another popular tools: apachebench (aka ab) wrk. order do tests properly, have perform tests another machine, even i use new instance test the instances, think the local computer is enough test of plans. there is drawback, need good internet connection, preferably a small latency a great bandwidth, all tests are going be performed parallel. m using symmetric fiber optic internet access enough bandwidth, thus did had constrain my side. with bigger plans, specially wrk testing more simultaneous connections would eventually problem, that case good vps server perform tests be probably better solution. cold an online service that make more difficult costly reproducibility these tests anyone their own. i use another tools (locust, gatling, etc), they more requirements would cause more trouble sooner the local machine. wrk is enough their own saturate almost vps web server very small requirements the local machine, faster. avoid install compile software the local machine, specially wrk is present all distributions, m going use docker images (williamyeh/wrk jordi/ab) perform tests. the circumstances these tests, using docker almost does cause performance loss the local machine, is more enough. if want test bigger plans more stress, it be wiser install locally both tools perform tests them.anyway, is moment, matter software use perform tests ( specially wrk), when testing wordpress requests are much the system runs of memory the mysql database is killed eventually apache server is killed too the test persists enough, until the server be unavailable a few minutes ( times never recover its own i had restart from control panel). all, is kind mini ddos attack are performing here. can improved lot other stack components a careful configuration. thing here is all the instances are tested the same configuration. thus, do try here test maximum capacity a server much i try compare under same circumstances. avoid lost ssh connection ( have perform manual intervention) the servers, limit connections until certain point, pause playbook five minutes then restart stack before perform next test. the servers where memory available is less 1gb, be able install stacks, set swap cache file 512gb. to perform tests deactivate cache memory compare of in default offered conditions.wordpressapachebenchrequests graph show number requests achieved several
