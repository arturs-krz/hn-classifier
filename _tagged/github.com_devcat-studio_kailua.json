[--> <type>] describes function type. is valid before function keyword (yes, for anonymous functions). is equivalent --: and -->, much more readable. names should identical the corresponding declarations. variadic arguments be written ...: <type> the end arguments. multiple returns need parentheses. general rule the thumb is all functions to typed either --v --:/--> unless is obvious the preceding context. allows to write code f(function(, b) ... end), only f is known accept such function.--v method(<name>: <type> ...) [--> <type>] describes method type. is same function, for declarations function :b(...). kailua tries infer type self, if 's possible should function .b(self, ...) --v function(...) instead the clarity.--# ... is special directive the type checker.--# open <built- library name> loads corresponding built- names also implicitly specifies language variant is currently use. only supported name far is lua51, the vanilla lua 5.1. is preload.open configuration options actually , and should probably put to first non-comment line the entry point you don't those options.--# type [local | global] <name> = <type> be used declare type alias. are three flavors typa alises: local is locally scoped (much local statements), global is globally scoped (much a = ...), no modifier indicates the type is exported the current file they should locally visible require. local types be the inner scopes. unlike variable names, inner type names should overwrite outer names.--# assume [global] <name>: <type> overrides type given name. global keyword forces global assignment, otherwise new scope is created local statements. is useful sidestepping checker issue, it is highly unsafe. at own risk.more directives are likely come. equal kind special comments span multiple lines.--# type date = {--# hour: integer;--# min: integer;--# sec: integer;--# }types following basic types are recognized:nil, boolean ( bool), number, string, function, userdata, thread, table primitive lua types.integer ( int) a check- integral subset number. ( the future, the lua 5.3 mode later, will also recognized primitive.)true false, integer string literals are valid subtypes boolean, integer string, respectively. table type is divided four useful cases.importantly, two cases are automatically inferred the and should explicitly annotated local tab = {} --: vector<integer>.vector<t> a table consecutive integer keys.map<key, value> a homogeneous associative table.{ key1: t1, key2: t2 } records, whose keys are strings fixed the check . you use semicolons place commas.explicitly declared records are \"inextensible\" default, meaning the list fields is complete cannot altered. can it extensible putting ... the end fields; allows lazy initialization records table.field = 'string'. the hands, normal lua table is implicitly typed extensible records, made inextensible required.{ t1, t2, t3 } tuples, whose keys are consecutive integers. otherwise are similar records.function(arg, ...) function(arg, ...) --> ret functions. ret be multiple types, which case need parentheses (function(vector<t>, integer) --> (integer, string)). arguments be named function(: string, b: number).t | t | ... union types. are mostly useful literal types (e.g. \"read\" | \"write\" | \"execute\"). kailua has very limited support checking kinds union types. has type information. --# assume is only to it useful.whatever (note case) is hole the type checker always accepts. map<integer, whatever> map<whatever, string> are compatible; map<integer, whatever> map<string, string> are . as thwarts basic type checking, at own risk. kailua types are default checked nil. is, can assign nil integer you also add integers; valid kailua code still result a runtime error therefore. restriction was required making practical type checker without changing source programming language. can opt two nil-handling modes you need make explicit. they are (transitively) freely assignable, consider more machine-readable documentation.t? accepts nil it is aware it contain nil. integer?s cannot added. also allows missing fields missing arguments ( are allowed otherwise): type {: integer?, b: integer} contain either { = 42, b = 54} {b = 54}, not { = 42}.t! guarantees it cannot contain nil., the table values are always t t? ( the obvious reason).finally, types the names table values optionally a const prefix. cannot modify innard const types: map<integer, const vector<string>>. can still assign them (otherwise type won't useful all).avoiding type checker annotating everything is practical, kailua supports ways avoid type checking more localized guarantees:--v [no_check] function(...) disables type checking the following function.kailua essentially believes specified function type, can no longer omitted. can override file check having .kailua files. require() was used a check- string kailua makes of package.path package.cpath set. package.path, will try f.kailua before reading file f. package.cpath, will always f.kailua f be probably binary. (note this normally result two extensions .lua.kailua unless have sole ? the search paths.).kailua files frequently --# assume you should assume the original code has given types.configuration format can configure exact behavior kailua kailua.json. is json comments (//) stray comma allowed convenience:{ // indicates where start. is only mandatory field the file. // // can a single string an array strings, in latter case // multiple paths are separately ( possibly parallelly) checked against. // checking sessions not affect others, reports are merged. \"start_path\": [\"entrypoint.lua\", \"lib/my_awesome_lib.lua\"], // are values `package.path` `package.cpath` variables, respectively. // are always relative the base directory // ( directory containing `.vscode` `kailua.json` whichever being used). // refer the lua manual the exact format. // // the configuration can a special `{start_dir}` sequence // gets replaced the directory containing *current* start path. // if are start paths `foo/.lua` `bar/b.lua`, // path `{start_dir}/?.lua` expand `foo/?.lua` `bar/?.lua` // each start path. is useful you are working multiple projects // individual directories, sharing portion common codes. // // they are explicitly set, are inferred any assignments // `package.path` `package.cpath` variables. can handy scripts, // will cumbersome most cases. // // should also noted any path `package_cpath` won't directly // read kailua; `.kailua` files associated them be read. \"package_path\": \"?.lua;contrib/?.lua\", \"package_cpath\": \"native/?\", // preloading options populate environment before checking. // are executed the following order, in each array, given order. \"preload\": { // list `--# open` arguments. \"open\": [\"lua51\"], // list `require()` arguments. affected `package_*` options. \"require\": [\"depa\", \"depb.core\"], },} also internal documentation is available a different file.licensekailua is dual-licensed under mit license apache license 2.0 your option. contributing kailua agree your contributions be licensed under two licenses."
