'm developer avid open source contributor. spent weekend my wife some friends the house a friend mentor whidbey island, haven both rest creativity me. was reading toni morrison's novel, home. as read, looked over puget sound had few thoughts rapid succession: wish could write this., i did write novel once. no ever read .it almost a team writers make great. rails, jquery. node.js. open source novel.why? work a software developer, the fact the technologies which make daily living been developed made freely available an army volunteers never ceases blow mind. 've seen amazing code out the open source community i began wonder why had stop code.further, have never considered myself writer, i knew would a lot me be vulnerable enough put work into world to open up scrutiny collaboration. believe this story has promise, that, witht help a lot people have never met, could grow something truly worth reading contributing. is story ?in 2006, had awful data entry temp job an office denver. only thing made tolerable was i worked a fascinating law student named garreth had moved denver his fianc√©e being displaced hurricane katrina. day, were talking lunch, he was relating of more eerie, unbelievable, heartbreaking stories had from aftermath the storm. that found endlessly fascinating was there were offices public records had been flooded had lost data personal identification. meanwhile, many orleans residents had lost birth certificates, drivers licenses, other pieces identification the flood. garreth took bite his sandwich stared past . \"the dmv had just people's word they were they said were.\" the next several months, became obsessed this detail its implications the concept identity. moses und aron, , is identical twin brothers grappling identity post-katrina orleans. is a secular reimagining an unfinished opera the composer arnold schoenberg the biblical story moses aaron. don't worry's nearly pretentious it sounds, you don't necessarily to anything new orleans, katrina, schoenberg contribute. a love the language the desire contribute what be groundbreaking project.why novel? think code just form writing, particular style. me, novel was closest artistic analogue code. would more difficult , say, open source painting a piece choreography. within writing, could've been poem, short story, essay. could've taken almost other format. i had novel had been sitting it. also seemed me be like large framework rails. is large , and larger is, more room is collaboration.is any ?not nearly good it be a collaborative community.why start together? wanted encourage much collaboration i , and intuitively, thought encouraging to file pull request fix typo two might easier sell writing whole chapter, that couple small contributions lead something bigger. don't a github account! do contribute?, this be beginning your foray open source contribution. creating account is free, even you don't follow typical process forking project, making own changes, reporting issues using project's issue tracker counts contributing. if really don't to an account, can always email your changes ( nick [] nickcox.) and 'll them you. needs be done? short, 's lot. check issues. whole novel is roughly copy edited, it needs love. , having written in month, 'm entirely certain it is completely coherent, has satisfying ending, has most compelling character development. are going do it?glad asked. another part this repository eventually the files make ebook of . my plan of is gather many pull requests possible , when 's done, publish , prominently naming contributors. will made available an ebook a print--demand paperback using pay you model. rationale this is , in experience, place higher value things they pay .because is community , the money should back the community. think best to distribute will to donate proceeds dave eggers' inimitable charity, 826 national, non-profit offers writing tutoring under-resourced students. will measure success?great question. is experiment see a community create besides incredible javascript framework. i'm less concerned how many copies ultimately sells , honestly, much money raise charity (although will amazing). rather, think the number contributors, volume pull requests, the richness the issue discussions be where true success be found. will do this takes off?, i at least more novel waiting the wings."
