'll contain experiments cool papers i read. hopefully, notebooks be helpful anyone reading!cnn's noisy labels - notebook looks a recent paper discusses convolutional neural networks are trained random labels ( some probability) are still able acheive accuracy mnist. thought the paper showed eye-brow raising results, i went ahead tried out myself. was pretty amazing see even training cnn random labels 50% the , and correct labels other 50% the , the network was still able get 90+% accuracy.character level rnn - notebook shows how train character level rnn tensorflow. idea was inspired andrej karpathy's famous blog post was based this keras implementation. this notebook, 'll learn more what model is doing, how can input own dataset, train model generate similar looking text.convolutional neural networks - notebook goes through simple convolutional neural network implementation tensorflow. model is very similar the own described the tensorflow docs. hopefully notebook give a better understanding what is necessary create train own cnns. a more conceptual view cnns, check my introductory blog post them.generative adversarial networks - notebook goes through creation a generative adversarial network. gans are of hottest topics deep learning. a high level, gans are composed two components, generator a discriminator. discriminator has task determining whether given image looks natural (ie, is image the dataset) looks it has been artificially created. task the generator is create natural looking images are similar the original data distribution, images look natural enough fool discriminator network. more a conceptual view gans, check my blog post.linear logistic regression - notebook shows how tensorflow is just deep learning library, is library centered numerical computation, allows to create classic machine learning models relatively easily. linear regression logistic regression are of most simple, yet useful models all machine learning.simple neural networks - notebook shows how create simple 1 2 layer neural networks. 'll see these networks perform mnist, look the type hyperparamters affect model's accuracy (network architecture, weight initialization, learning rate, etc)math tensorflow - notebook introduces to variables, constants, placeholders tensorflow. 'll into describing sessions, showinng how perform typical mathematical operations deal large matrices.question pair classification rnns - notebook looks the newly released question pair dataset released quora little earlier year. looks the ways which can build machine learning model predict whether sentences are duplicates one another.selu nonlinearity - recent paper titled \"self normalizing neural networks\" started getting lot buzz starting june 2017. main contribution the paper was new nonlinear activation function called selu (scaled exponential linear unit). 'll looking how function performs practice simple neural nets cnns."
