's discrete.axes, directions the geometry building rule kgrid have 6 axes 12 directions. we define shapes within kgrid align sides the axes.'s building rule. as we were building shapes of unit triangle shaped tiles ( the kisrhombille tessellation, above).object classeskpointclass kpoint{ ant bat cat dog}3 examples kpoint kpoint is point the kgrid.ant, bat, cat dog are integers.values ant, bat cat are range [minint,maxint], though combinations values are invalid.value dog is range [0,5].kgridclass kgrid{ origin north fish twist}2 examples kgrid kgrid is instance our coordinate system defined terms the plane. shares name the geometry system it implements.origin is 2d point. specifies location kpoint(0,0,0,0).north is floating point value describing direction. 's direction kpoint(0,0,0,0) kpoint(0,0,0,2).fish is floating point value. is unit interval. shortest side our unit triangle.twist is value denoting chirality. clockwise counterclockwise. probably boolean. gives the direction east west relative north. 's the direction we when traversing perimenter that hexagon-based figure we for dog ( above).ksegkseg{ p0 p1} kseg is line segment a kgrid.p0 p1 are kpoints. points define line segment. line segments our system align the axes the system, viz points a kseg are always coaxial. above details axes.kpolygonkpolygon{ points}akpolygon is polygon a kgrid.points is list 3..n kpoints. each adjacent pair points defines kseg. thus, is case ksegs, kpolygon is aligned the axes our coordinate system. above details axes.nesting geometryrecall we define kgrid using 4 params : origin, north, fish twist ( above). can derive params a kpolygon. can derive origin v0, north dir(v0,v1), fish dis(v0,v1) twist the chirality the polygon's point sequence. (2) example.given grid0create polygon ( hexagon ) in grid0. from polygon derive params a grid, grid1.grid1.origin is real point p0.grid1.north is real direction p0 p1.grid1.fish is derived the distance p0 p1 (dp0p1). m, distance p0 p1 terms grid0.fish. grid1.fish = dp0p1 / m.grid1.twist is derived the chirality the vertex sequence. clockwise chirality means twist=true.thus define new grid, grid1.(note our grid is actually constrained the area the polygon, 'm illustrating that to it clear.) can use 4th param, integer, density. dividing new fish density can control resolution the grid.(3) (4)3 densities then, within new grid, can define another polygon, so .obviously suggests we create kind infinite nesting structure, variety vector fractal. could implement play geometry geometry operators some kind shape grammar, manage symmetry grouping somehow get stuff this the forsythia fractal more that.footnotes(1) yes could it 3 integers (2 the hexagon 1 the figure) right we're doing with 4. going 3 mean rewriting bunch code.(2) details fish derivation. derive fish getting length (v0,v1) terms fish ( adding the segs) divide real distance v0 v1 that get fish.(3) density control divide fish the density param.(4) are exploiting special property the kisrhombille tessellation here. property the same shape being describable an infinite range tessellation resolutions. property is shared square triangle tessellations not hexagon tessellations."
