is component? why you it? is minimum definition a component? is module, what does contain? is service, when you it? is promise? explain laymen's terms. are lifecycle hooks components directives? are pipes? me example. are differences between reactive forms template driven forms? is dumb, presentation, component? are benefits using dumb components?ability build simple app do components communicate each ?how you http load data server? do create routes? can get current state a route? do create -way data binding? do load external modules? would display form validation errors? lifecycle hook you to unsubscribe observable? are services injected your application? would create route parameters access from component?basic conceptswhy you angular instead another framework, e.g., react? is difference between observable a promise? is difference between component a directive?why you typescript aka benefits typescript?why different life cycle hooks are needed a component/directive?why does angular rxjs? is purpose using zone.js? is difference between ngoninit() the constructor() a component? will ngoninit() called? would make of ngoninit()? are benefits using formbuilder?[answers link coming soon ]intermediate level be the intermediate level, have build least medium sized angular app. have have familiarity routing, https, different built process, unit test, etc. here are questions could expect.essential terminology questions will protect route authorized user ?what is custom pipe how you it? is structural directive? is difference between routermodule.forroot() vs routermodule.forchild()? why is important? is difference between module's forroot() forchild() methods why you need ?what's difference between dirty, touched, pristine a form element? is async pipe? kind data be used async pipe? is injectable? me example. is pure pipe? will create -way data binding angular?comfortability build medium size app questions do components communicate each ?how you decide create new ngmodule? will inject custom header your http call? do identify structural directive html? would select custom component style ?how you select the child components' elements? would cache observable data? would save data a form control? event emitters works angular? do mock service inject a unit test?core concepts understandability questionstell about feature module shared module? would not put a shared module?why angular uses decorator? is async validation how is done?why you need type definitions? components be notified an event is emitted?why you export ngmodule?why is bad sharedmodule provides service a lazy loaded module? you explain difference between activatedroute routerstate? service you put the module why?[answers link coming soon]expert level are rockstar angular. can teach . you lead team angular developers.performance edge case related terminology is factory component? is lazy loading why you it? is ahead time (aot) compilation why you it? are of angular style guide suggestions follow your code? why? is wildcard state? do put animation between states? would a use ngzone service? would protect component being activated through router? would insert embedded view a prepared templateref? is attribute directive why you it?master large app will intercept http inject header each http call? would create component display error messages throughout application? will parallelize multiple observable call? will put async call before another? can use web worker angular app? tools you to find performance issue your code? are ways may improve website's scrolling performance?explain difference between layout, painting compositing. can cancel router navigation? would animate routing? would cancel promise which are waiting?rockstar fighter angular questions does lazy loaded module is loaded?why angular uses url segment? will make angular app secure? will localize numbers currencies dates? is best to translation your app? will setup different environment build differently your app? will use scss css preprocessing your application? will optimize image/svg your angular app? would make sure api call needs be called once with multiple conditions? example: you need get data multiple routes , once get , you reuse in routes needs , therefor need make another call your backend apis. you need respond two different observable/subject one callback function, would do ? (ex: you need change url through route parameters with prev/next buttons).[answers link coming soon]coding testsometimes interviewer gives real coding test. of suck those feel ashamed ourselves then continue work the current job. don't you saty that miserable job. hence, the following coding challenges master .fetch data display user profile test has three levellevel 1: am giving an api https://api.github.com/search/users?q=eric api takes query parameter name \"q\" passes query string server. server returns bunch users. i you create input text box button that can type anything the text box hit the button retrieve data the given api. upon retrieval display total_count first 10 users the search result. detail instruction this test is available herelevel 2: convert each user profile a router link that upon clicking each user profile will navigate a route has \"login\" property the route. pass user.login route parameter. create separate component where will read route parameter then fetch data that user using api https://api.github.com/users/eric . please notice last part this api is user.login ( route parameter you passed). finally display user image few information the componentlevel 3: any charting framework you find then create simple bar chart display number followers first 10 users coding test judge ability use services, component, routing, data visualization, external module, observables, etc.[sample code link coming soon]persistent todo list test has three levelslevel 1: implement simple todo list where can add items, mark donelevel 2: create few categories todo list make persistence the browserlevel 3: use firebase (serverless database) make todo list persistence across multiple devices coding test judge whether can pass data events between components. , whether are leveraging directives understand difference between component directives.[sample code link coming soon]student registration system test has three levelslevel-1: design system where students login register different courseslevel-2: add feature that faculties each course view many students registered the courseslevel-3: ( need shower. add text here i clean myself) coding test judge understanding architecture a large application. ability think implement module, lazy loading, asset management etc.[sample code link coming soon]side things related questionsrxjswhy unsubscribing is important? is difference between map flatmap?whare are different ways can create observable? is forkjoin, zip, share?difference between hot cold observables.typescript would debug typescript file? do implement interface typescript? would call base class constructor child class typescript? is typescript language service? to declare custom type? are disadvantages typescirpt? answers hereangular-cliwhy you angular cli? would run unit test? do create application use scss? to inject base href? would extract webpack config angular cli project?others is use codelyzer? you angular material2? would set different config different deployment server? do know es6? is ngupgrage? you how can run angularjs angular side side?[answers link coming soon]note god a press release, god expressed apologies send author this repo a non-english speaking country creating weekends.contributors js dudejesse m. holmes you?few questions are inspired yonet, codeproject"
