	"content": "hacking soundcloud: creating interactive track i used web automation tools create interactive release 10 min read#bringing message the medium most in electronic/club music scenes, spend lot time soundcloud. was early, hardcore adopter the platform. fact, probably within first 3000 users, shown my id their system:{ \"id\": 2925, \"kind\": \"user\", \"permalink\": \"rawfare\", \"username\": \"rawfare\", \"last_modified\": \"2017/04/21 14:45:27 +0000\", \"uri\": \"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/2925\", \"permalink_url\": \"http://soundcloud.com/rawfare\"}'m they call \"digital native\" always produced music computers started djing way, too. given history the scene, also felt need master real dj-ing well. day got good offer a pair technics 1210s decided take plunge. i was playing the turntables, came realize natural must felt the original wave electronic musicians have work distributed played vinyl. would manipulate music their hands, in turn radically influenced structure rhythmic patterns the tracks were making. was similar how experienced music grew with, the same mode listening cultural relation. direct sensory emotional connection made music easier appreciate both the maker the audience. felt semblances that, growing mostly listening copied cassettes(!) files/mp3s (skipped cds almost entirely ridiculous format). the nuanced, personal connection is fully severed today. almost of interaction music is managed mediated middlemen spotify, youtube, soundcloud, apple... determine full context within the music appears, only 5% 10% the visible screen space under artist's control. a track finishes playing, semi-random follows without asking. both artist the listener are moved far the controls possible, order tweak, optimize steer actions towards whatever makes platform appear successful. situation is incredibly bizarre devices our pockets are more powerful the computers made majority electronic music. could literally the same music generated the fly your phone. , it be interactive ways never before possible. 's most mindblowing yet ignored underutilized musical context ever.'ve been possessed this realization, started exploring possibilities taking control. are ways make music more interactive, artists should messing directly the format how publish musical ideas today. was vinyl, cds, now 's internet itself.'m music producer performer i didn't much shit computers programming, more it was necessary anyway. see things tools expression. every musician should understand instruments the context their . today, context is internet, we need deal it # track track pipo is tribute my crazy amsterdam neighbor's parrot. neighbor the was spending lot time home, much it screaming her parrot pipo regular 15-20 minute intervals. our flat, became both running joke a genuine nuisance. even considered adopting bird. day 2014, vocal performances inspired simple rave-tinged track just sort materialized, i've been sitting it since. many ways, found to a great fit a fun experiment. 've increasingly felt releasing tracks a standard, static doesnt much sense anymore. doesnt . the shelf life a typical release is getting ridiculously short get week, maybe of peak attention best. great works buried under avalanche new content, racking only few hundred listens. wanted reflect relationship somehow connecting markers everyone seems care (play counts etc.) the content the track itself. short, idea was make pipo alive. real world pipo commanded constant attention sacrifice. like neighbor's screaming, track had be annoying possible. a lifelong fan explorer distortion, using effect was instictive fit1i'm aware distortion electronic music feels strangely dated right . it's cringy hipster thing got decontextualized. original aesthetics grew as expression the natural environment the producers using cheap, lo-fi equipment nobody wanted then, instead the rare expensive vintage analog collectors items traded the -too wannabes today. amazing made noises beatiful promoted to focal point their . nevertheless, think deserve free pass this. distortion is huge part the sound my rawfare project. 'm exploring new sonic territory , but m happy ve found good, fresh angle use . (btw want thank adam harper driving notion home me. lectures completely changed i about music sound design. even made start selling of analog gear started slide ). i put final master the track through of favorite tools ended with handful trashed- versions. that, idea was fully formed upload completely distorted track soundcloud, change to progressively cleaner versions more listened it, gradually dial distortion if weekly play counts are insufficient. is result its very current state:# soundcloud replacer you pay a pro account soundcloud, 'll the possibility replace audio file uploaded the track, without losing of statistics. feature is godsend case make mistake needs be corrected, a bad version the recording. however, more interesting is change track entirely, depending some feedback. order do , the replacement process had be fully automated. initial thought was program using soundcloud api, is short application programming interface. is way access applications without using graphical user interface way humans , clicking tapping screens. api allows to the raw data without unnecessary baggage a website an app. virtually every app has api it's typically used other apps scrutinizing data embedding content. interactions like short example the beginning this post. soundcloud's api is too bad while can it make programs upload delete tracks connected accounts, doesn't allow to replace .of course, was going stop . luckily 's way make almost anything the internet bend your using browser automation. almost software makers, probably soundcloud themselves well, browser automation test parts their application. the code changes, automated tests are run against to if changes broke other parts the application accident. of , browsers all kinds special hooks built them allows to mimic anything real would clicking, typing, navigating, pressing buttons2you need special version the browser. most common browser options are selenium phantomjs. this project, 've used webdriver.io a scripting framework control .. it's much a string puppet, you how use . the details took quite time figure , but you see, process works (this is 100% automated, ghost--the-machine style stuff 'm touching anything): can recreate exact steps would to replace track yourself, writing script (literally, for actors):browser// to soundcloud.com.url('https://soundcloud.com')// chill half second.pause(500)// locate login button.element('.loginbutton')// click it.click(.loginbutton)// wait until login ('modal') window pops .waitforvisible('.modal__modal', 7000)// double check this is true.isvisiblewithinviewport('.modal__modal')// enter username....setvalue('[name=username]', 'rawfare').click('[title=continue]').pause(500)// enter password btw 's much smarter // to handle logins, is homework .keys('*************')// press enter key.keys('return') .pause(1500)// go the address the track.url(trackurl)// wait more button appear then click.waitforvisible('.sc-button-more', defaulttimeout).click('.sc-button-more')// wait and click edit button....waitforvisible('.sc-button-edit', defaulttimeout).click('.sc-button-edit')// wait until 'modal' edit window appears.waitforvisible('.soundedittabs', defaulttimeout) // upload new cover image// ( are imagechooser elements the page.// sure select one the pop-, not other .).choosefile('.soundedittabs .imagechooser__fileinput', imagepath)// // meat the script choosing new sound file // replace track .choosefile('.choosefiles__input', filepath)// while 's uploading, proceed focus // the description field change update .click('.basefields__description textarea')// sure 're the end the description field .keys('arrowdown').keys('end')// real life has be repeated 20x, // length current format ....keys('backspace')// simulate typing current , // to showcase we changed track (utc timezone).keys(currenttime)// different to click save changes, also // powerful example how do almost anything // could within given page running arbitrary// function it's context .execute(() => { document .queryselector('[title=\"save changes\"]') .click()})// wait until little notification thing shows saying track was updated successfully.waitforvisible('.gritter--image', 360000, 1500).gettext('.gritter--image').( (text) => { // check it says was // updated successfullly expect(text) .tocontain('updated successfully')}) this point had automated process replacing track, i still needed decide distorted version take. this, needed good to access listener feedback. 'm obsessed that topic since turntable moment. artists face same environment today: are slaves metrics \"engagement\" listens, play counts, follows, likes, sign-ups so . these metrics a significant real world effect, influencing media attention, bookings sponsorship opportunities. are several analytics tools help track , as as -called \" gates\". gates typically offer access a free download return a follow repost. me, all off sleazy marketing tools. feel inherently embarrassing, probably the reason they're ill-suited any creative interpretation. is why 've built own tracking engine called songsling.io the course 2016. powers my interactive musical artworks. aim was build something can turn online projects tamagotchis virtual pets need be fed the visible feedback your audience. the online metrics can measure are patched in control artworks themselves. 've used for first to present bomb ep, gradually unlocked tracks more listened them. also powers pipo. since needed engine be working me non-stop, had set my own cloud servers. takes bit figure , but s incredibly cheap 100% worth just the learning experience alone. highly encourage to it shot, you're slightly inclined3here's discount digitalocean. alternatively, post has a comparison cloud hosting providers.. you is possibility build your own army automated robots (shell scripts) do exactly you tell , any also while sleep. automation is coming affect in big , and should learn of to improve creative output. robot assistants set for pipo roughly tasks: * every 5-10 minutes, check the latest playback statistics * calculate project score the growth the plays, etc. based their assigned weights (different multipliers plays youtube soundcloud are worth more facebook) * project score is stored checked by another automated bot every 15-30 minutes. bot determines whether change is necessary. * a threshold has been reached, spins the necessary virtual computers (containers4i'm orchestrating using tool called docker.). happens mere seconds. container runs string-puppeted browser, the one automation script series steps needed replace track soundcloud. * theyre done their assigned tasks, virtual computers shut down automatically patiently sleep until next occassion.'s basically . thanks all the above, pipo is always changing. hope inspires to try something similar. and mess the internet. more pipo, can listen grab sound file his dedicated web shrine. visuals & 3d assets are work dlgnce, amazing 3d artist was fortunate collaborate for release. music video went online the 1000 plays: post briefly made onto hacker news front page .check the discussion."
