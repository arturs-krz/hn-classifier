shell command call assertible deployments script automatically run api tests. grab deployment script the section, should like : curl -u your_api_token: https://assertible.com/deployments -d'{ \"service\": \"your_service_id\", \"version\": \"v1\" } * add script the text input the shell command jenkins: a real-world scenario, will likely adding command a build step an existing jenkins job. either case, script should run right your api is deployed. a refresher, post-deploy testing script makes post request assertible, will automatically run tests against api. you're deploying a staging qa environment, can the environmentname parameter specify url tests run against. check the deployments api documentation see more options examples. pro tip! keep senstive information the command provide, your assertible_api_token assertible_service_id, can environment variables jenkins. running jobalright! jenkins job is set with build step run api tests. , let's run build make sure everything is set correctly. * your jenkins job dashboard, click build : this start build begin going through build steps. the shell command succeeds, should ablue ball indicating successful build. * navigate the console output tab the build see details the post request, including id the deployment was created: you something the image above, congratulations! now a jenkins build will continuously test web services. the next sections, 'll discuss tomanage api tests assertible,set failure alerts, andadd status checks your github pull requsts. api test results assertible in assertible dashboard, find resultstab your web service. results the tests executed jenkins be available, all the details the assertions: you at details near top, 'll the results were executed via deployment. learn more the different options running post-deploy api tests the docs. configure test failure notifications of most important parts continuous testing is getting alerted web service failures. assertible has several options can to customize and you're notified test failures. * email hooks email hooks are enabled default send email a test fails. * zapier hooks last method receiving alerts is the zapier integration. zapier integration allows trigger zap your tests fail, you do almost anything test result data. can evenopen issue github api tests fail. * slack notifications great alternative email notifications is install slack integration tosend message a channel tests fail. slack notifications are ideal teams where multiple are charge responding web service failures. bonus: github status checks api test results is very basic example a jenkins job. many cases, jenkins is used build, test, deploy code changes a github repository a ci/cd server. assertible add github status checks your pull requests show result your api tests. you github, can enable status checks your api tests byconnecting web service a github repo, adding github: true parameter your deployment script. learn more aboutsetting github status checks. wrapping using jenkins assertible, 's easy continuously test web services every deployment on schedule interval.more resources tutorials * add post-deploy smoke tests any codeship pipeline * why should add api testing your continuous integration pipeline * tutorial: automate smoke tests a api heroku * docs: api test automation assertible any questions comments?
