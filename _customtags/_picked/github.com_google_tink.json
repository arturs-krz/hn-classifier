an officialgoogle product. particular, is meant a replacement successor keyczar.important: tink is still work--progress, api might change bedeprecated without notice. hope change policy once tinkstabilizes.getting startedtink performs cryptographic tasks via -called primitives, each which isdefined via corresponding interface specifies functionality theprimitive. example, symmetric key encryption is offered via aead-primitive (authenticated encryption associated data), supports operations:encrypt(plaintext, associated_data), encrypts given plaintext(using associated_data additional aead-input) returns resultingciphertextdecrypt(ciphertext, associated_data), decrypts given ciphertext(using associated_data additional aead-input) returns resultingplaintextcurrently tink already provides primitives several common cryptographicoperations ( symmetric encryption, message authentication codes, digitalsignatures, hybrid encryption), additional primitives are preparation.moreover, tink lets users add primitives custom implementations existing primitives, allows to build upon tink's core architecture key manangement abilities without having fork library. basic of tink proceeds three steps:load generate cryptographic key material ( keyset tink terms). the key material get instance the chosen primitive. that primitive accomplish cryptographic task. be more concrete, here is these steps look when performingsymmetric encryption (aead) a java program: import com.google.cloud.crypto.tink.aead; import com.google.cloud.crypto.tink.aead.aeadfactory; import com.google.cloud.crypto.tink.keysethandle; // [...] // 1. the key material. keysethandle keysethandle = ...; // 2. the primitive. aead aead = aeadfactory.getprimitive(keysethandle); // 3. the primitive. byte[] ciphertext = aead.encrypt(plaintext, aad); step #1 above can a keysethandle an existing keyset kept astorage system...keysethandle keysethandle = somekeystorage.loadkeyset(keysetid);... generate fresh key material using template, defines shape the key:keysethandle keysethandle = cleartextkeysethandle.generatenew(keytemplate); flow is identical other primitives. instance, here is to the message authentication code (mac) primitive (notice usage macfactory): import com.google.cloud.crypto.tink.mac; import com.google.cloud.crypto.tink.mac.macfactory; import com.google.cloud.crypto.tink.keysethandle; // [...] // 1. the key material. keysethandle keysethandle = ...; // 2. the primitive. mac mac = macfactory.getprimitive(keysethandle); // 3. the primitive. byte[] macvalue = mac.computemac(data);before specific implementation a primitive be used, must registered runtime the tink library, that \"knows\" desiredimplementations. example, one like use standardimplementations aead mac primitives offered tink, initializationlooks follows: import com.google.cloud.crypto.tink.aead.aeadconfig; import com.google.cloud.crypto.tink.mac.macconfig; // [...] // register standard implementations aead mac primitives. aeadconfig.registerstandardkeytypes(); macconfig.registerstandardkeytypes(); that already how use tink ( is really simple!), canproceed using in code. alternatively, can continue reading sections below get more information the library: features,security, structure, extensibility, more. get direct instructions how accomplish certain tasks tink java -to.tink overviewbasic features tink provides set basic tools perform common cryptotasks a variety environments. main operations are accessible via-called primitives, represent cryptographic tools.currently tink supports following cryptographic operations:authenticated encryption associated data (primitive: aead)message authentication codes (primitive: mac),digital signatures (primitives: publickeysign publickeyverify)hybrid encryption (primitives: hybridencrypt hybriddecrypt). the future primitives be added, e.g. deterministic encryption(e.g., siv modes), pseudorandom function (e.g., hmac a prf), strongpseudorandom permutation (e.g., heh).envelope encryption tink supportsenvelopeencryption (.k.. kmsenvelope) is getting popular cloud users. this mode, cloud usersgenerate data encryption key (dek) locally, encrypt data dek, send dek a key management system (kms) such aws kms google cloud kms beencrypted, stores encrypted dek encrypted data; a later point cloudusers retrieve encrypted data dek, the kms decrypt dek, usedecrypted dek decrypt data.key management addition cryptographic operations tink provides support key management features key versioning, key rotation, storing loading keys key management systems, more. example, acryptographic scheme is found broken, can switch a implementation the primitive rotating key without changing recompiling code.currently, tink supports following key management systems:google cloud kmsamazon kmsandroid keystore system (planned)apple ios keychain (planned) can easily add support in-house key management system, without having change anything tink.composability, extensibility, interoperability core tink isrelatively small, most components be selected assembled various combinations satisfy specific user requirements code size performance. example, you need digital signatures, don't to include authenticated encryption your compiled code. is easy add primitives, protocols interfaces tink.without touching core library, easily add support newalgorithms, ciphertext formats, new key management systems (e.g.,-house hardware security modules), etc.tink produces consumes ciphertexts are compatible other libraries.except a few cases, implementations crypto primitives tink fromexisting libraries such openssl, boringssl, nacl, bouncy castle, openjdk,etc. tink is a rewrite these underlying libraries, is rather high-level abstraction them, supports ciphertext formats algorithmssupported these libraries.languages platforms tink java is field tested ready production. c++ is active development we're planning support go,python, javascript. tink supports android, linux (google cloud engine amazonec2), google app engine. ios support is active development.primitives their implementationsprimitives represent cryptographic operations offered tink, hence form core tink api. primitive is an interface specifies operations are offered the primitive. primitive have multipleimplementations, user chooses desired implementation using key corresponding type ( the next section details).although implementations a given primitive be totally independent each , they have fulfill clearly-defined security contract, assure the of particular primitive does provide sufficientprotections does introduce security risks (security safety below). following table summarizes java implementations primitives arecurrently available planned ( latter are listed brackets).primitiveimplementationsaeadaes-eax, aes-gcm, aes-ctr-hmac, kms envelopemachmac-sha2digital signaturesecdsa nist curves, (eddsa ed25519)hybrid encryptionecies aead hkdf, (nacl cryptobox)tink user accesses implementations a primitive via factory corresponds the primitive: aead via aeadfactory, mac via macfactory, etc. where eachfactory offers corresponding getprimitive(...) methods. before factories be used, underlying registry has be initialized, can accomplished using corresponding config-classes: aeadconfig aead,macconfig mac, etc.key, keyset, keysethandle particular implementation a primitive is identified a cryptographickey structure contains key material parameters needed provide functionality the primitive. key structure is protocolbuffer, whose globally unique name (.k.. type url) is referred as keytype, is used an identifier the corresponding implementation aprimitive. particular implementation comes a form a keymanager understands key type: manager instantiate primitivecorresponding a given key, can generate keys the supported keytype. take advantage key rotation other key management features, tink userworks usually with single keys, with keysets, are sets keys some additional parameters metadata. particular, extrainformation the keyset determines key is primary (.e. be used create cryptographic data ciphertexts, signatures), keys areenabled (.e. be used process existing cryptographic data, decryptciphertext verify signatures), which keys should be used more. more details the structure keys, keysets related protocol buffers tink.proto. keys a keyset belong different implementations/key types, must implement same primitive. given keyset ( any given key) beused one primitive . moreover, protect accidental leakage corruption, tink user doesnt directly keysets, rather keysethandle objects, form wrapper around keysets. creation keysethandle objects be restricted specific factories (whose visibility be governed a white list), enable control actual storage the keys keysets, so avoid accidental leakage secret key material.security safetytink reduces common crypto pitfalls user-centered design, carefulimplementation code reviews, extensive testing.tink stems combined decades experience building breakingreal-world cryptosystems. are maintainers project wycheproof, framework validating correctness crypto libraries, thus tink has beencontinuously tested should safe against known crypto weaknesses.tink provides apis decrease potential abuse misuse. particular, implementations a high level interface are foolproof thesense: assume the attacker has complete freedom calling methods ahigh level interface; under assumption security is compromised. example the underlying encryption mode requires nonces is insecure nonces are reused the interface not allow pass nonces. alsoassume the attacker get access memory passed a method, if cryptographic operation (e.g. decryption) failed.tink's interfaces abstract away the underlying implementation. instancesare usable without knowing underlying class implements . it is possible change underlying implementation an interface without changes the call the interface. interfaces security guarantees must satisfied each primitive implementing interface. may exclude encryption modes. rather adding to existing interfaces weakening guarantees the interface is possible add interfaces describe security guarantees appropriately. good practice is use each key one purpose . the storage format tink keys contains information such correct usage the key bechecked runtime.readability tink declares cryptographic properties (e.g., whether safeagainst chosen-ciphertext attacks) through primitives (.e., interfaces),allowing security auditors automated tools quickly discovering incorrectusages. an abstract level think it is necessary know whether cryptosystem has been proposed rivest, shamir adleman by victorshoup, you should able determine an object implements encryption signature algorithm. , knowing an encryption mode isauthenticated is more important knowing uses aes. is why name interfaces generic possible (e.g., aead, publickeysign, etc.), not too general (e.g., crypter, signer, etc.)visibility tink provides standalone static types potential dangerousoperations (e.g., loading cleartext keys disk), allowing restricting,monitoring logging usages.maintainerstink is maintained :daniel
